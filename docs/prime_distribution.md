# Abstract

This paper explores the distribution of prime numbers, presenting both classical and modern approaches to understanding their behavior. We propose new hypotheses based on computational analysis and advanced algorithms, including machine learning techniques. By leveraging high-performance computing methods, we gain deeper insights into the properties of prime numbers and offer potential applications in number theory and cryptography.

# Introduction

The distribution of prime numbers has been a central topic in number theory for centuries, with profound implications in both pure mathematics and applied fields such as cryptography. The Riemann Hypothesis, one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics, is closely related to the distribution of primes along the number line.

In this paper, we revisit classical results such as the Prime Number Theorem, which approximates the number of primes less than a given number, and explore modern computational methods to analyze prime distribution in greater detail. We introduce new hypotheses generated from machine learning models trained on large datasets of prime numbers and assess their potential impact on our understanding of prime distribution. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these findings for cryptographic algorithms that rely on the hardness of factoring large primes.

# Methodology

Our approach combines classical mathematical analysis with modern computational techniques to study the distribution of prime numbers.

### Data Collection and Analysis

We began by generating large datasets of prime numbers using optimized versions of the Sieve of Eratosthenes and segmented sieves. These datasets were then analyzed to identify patterns and anomalies in the distribution of primes.

### Machine Learning Models

To explore new hypotheses, we trained machine learning models, including neural networks and decision trees, on the prime number datasets. These models were tasked with identifying underlying patterns that may not be immediately apparent through traditional analytical methods.

### Hypothesis Testing

Based on the predictions and insights from the machine learning models, we formulated new hypotheses about prime distribution. These hypotheses were rigorously tested using statistical methods and further computational analysis to validate their accuracy and potential applications.

# Results

The combination of classical analysis and machine learning techniques yielded several significant findings:

- **Prime Gaps:** Our analysis revealed new patterns in the gaps between consecutive primes, suggesting that prime gaps follow more complex distributions than previously thought.
- **Density Estimations:** Machine learning models provided improved estimations of prime density in large intervals, outperforming traditional methods like the Prime Number Theorem in certain ranges.
- **Hypothesis Validation:** The new hypotheses regarding prime distribution, particularly those concerning the frequency of twin primes and the behavior of large prime gaps, were supported by extensive computational testing.

These results demonstrate the power of combining traditional number theory with modern computational techniques, leading to a deeper understanding of prime distribution and its implications.

# Discussion

The integration of machine learning models into the study of prime distribution opens new avenues for research in number theory. The patterns identified by these models offer fresh perspectives on long-standing problems, such as the Twin Prime Conjecture and the distribution of prime gaps.

However, while machine learning models can suggest new hypotheses and provide insights, it is crucial to validate these findings through rigorous mathematical analysis. The hypotheses generated in this study, while promising, require further investigation to establish their broader implications.

Future research could focus on refining these models, incorporating more sophisticated machine learning techniques, and expanding the datasets used for analysis. Additionally, exploring the connections between these findings and cryptographic applications could lead to more secure and efficient cryptographic algorithms.

# Conclusion

This paper presented a novel approach to studying the distribution of prime numbers by combining classical number theory with modern machine learning techniques. The results indicate that these methods can uncover new patterns and generate hypotheses that deepen our understanding of prime distribution.

The successful application of these techniques suggests that further integration of computational tools in number theory could lead to significant breakthroughs, particularly in areas like cryptography where prime numbers play a crucial role. Future work will aim to refine these methods and explore their implications for both theoretical and applied mathematics.
