# Number Theory Project

## Overview

The **Number Theory Project** is a comprehensive Rust-based toolkit designed for researchers, educators, and developers interested in number theory and cryptography. The project encompasses a wide range of algorithms and tools, including prime number analysis, elliptic curve operations, Diophantine equations, and quantum-resistant cryptographic methods. The project is structured to be modular and extendable, making it suitable for both academic research and practical applications in secure communications.

## Features

- **Prime Number Distribution Analysis**: Visualize and analyze the distribution of prime numbers.
- **Factorization Algorithms**: Implementations of Pollard's Rho, trial division, and other methods for integer factorization.
- **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**: Support for multiple elliptic curves, including operations for key exchange and encryption.
- **Diophantine Equations**: Solvers for linear and non-linear Diophantine equations.
- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: Lattice-based and hash-based algorithms designed to be secure against quantum computing threats.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Use machine learning models to predict properties related to number theory and cryptographic applications.

## Installation

To get started with the project, ensure that you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your system. Then, clone the repository and build the project using Cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/number_theory_project.git
cd number_theory_project
cargo build --release
```

## Usage

### Running the Main Application

You can run the main application using:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

This will execute the default set of algorithms and display results based on the included modules.

### Running Tests

The project includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests to ensure the correctness of all implemented algorithms. To run the tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

### Documentation

Detailed documentation for each module is available in the `docs/` directory. This includes theoretical background, implementation details, and examples of usage.
